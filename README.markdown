The object of this project is to decode enough of the micro four thirds (MFT) lens-body communication protocol to be able to use MFT lenses on the Frankencamera F4.

So far, Steven Bell has worked on this using a PC logic analyzer to watch the commands going between the body and lens, and by using an Arduino to drive the lens.

The code in the repository is written for an Arduino Mega 2560.
